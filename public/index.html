                Overview
            </div>
            <div class="intro_text">
                Poverty, perhaps a relatively unfamiliar term for some, is still troubling a substantial number of people in the world.
                <br>
                In 2019, stil <b>1,800,000,000</b> people lived below the $3.65 per day poverty line.
                <br>
                More than <b>648,000,000</b> people did not even have $2.15 per day for living.
                <br><br>
                In terms of poverty, there are various topics for us to research on.
                <br>
                In this work, I focus on the inequity of the world with regard to poverty.
                <br><br>
                Until now, there is no unified standard for poverty, for each country's living standard and costs for essential supplements are different.
                <br>
                For instance, the housing price in Shanghai is higher than in Stuttgart, while cabbage in Stuttgart could be 5-time more expensive.
                <br>
                Nevertheless, some thresholds can still be used to measure poverty, such as the UN poverty line.
                <br>
                And if you look at some of the charts below, you will find that the inequity gap is too large to be explained as differences in standards.

                In this section, you will first look at a map showing the level of median income/expenditure of the world, which reflects inequity.
                <br>
                After that, a world map of poverty rate will be shown with the color shade to reflect poverty.

                    Divided by five continents, this chart shows the median income/expenditure level of each country. 
                    Although this median income/expenditure level is not a reflection of poverty,
                    for some countries, this figure is close to the definition of the poverty line in that country. 
                    For instance, many European countries define their poverty line as 'earning less than 60% of the average median income'.
                    <br><br>
                    In this chart, the size of each block represents how large the income number is.
                    You can find the obvious inequity through the presentation of this chart.

                    This chart is a vivid visualization of the different poverty levels in our world.
                    Measured by the same threshold —— upper-middle poverty line 
                    ($5.5 per day per person according to World Bank in 2011 price), 
                    certain countries have an astonishing poverty rate of 
                    over three-forths and even over 90% of the population.
